# Sharn's NvChad config

This is the repository which stores all the configuration I use on the daily!

The repository includes support for every language I am likely to code in. These
are:

- Python
- Julia
- R
- Rust
- Svelte
  - HTML
  - Javascript/Typescript
  - CSS
- Markdown
- Bash
- Terraform

At the moment I have not set up DAP's with this config, but it's still really
useful.
